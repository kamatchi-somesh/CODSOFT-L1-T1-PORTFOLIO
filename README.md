In this repository we can see 2 HTML files, the first one is the tailwind.html which has a tailwind CSS in it and another one portfolio.html which has an external CSS named as styles.CSS.
For this I added four images the first one is my profile image then next is my project images you can add N number of projects in it but now I have only three projects so I have added only 3 projects in this project.
